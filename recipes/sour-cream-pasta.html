        <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
            <p>Classic, simple Hungarian dish according to my wife. Won't impress guests but will do the job.</p>
        <h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Pasta</li>
                <li>Sour cream - if stranded in France, Creme Fraiche or Fromage Blanc can be used as a replacement but do try them first as they are quite different.</li>
                <li>Grated cheese</li>  
                <li>Garlic/Garlic powder</li>               
            </ul>
        <h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Boil the pasta in your favorite pasta-boiling pot. Salt and oil to taste although oil is supposed to be useless - you do you, though. Don't forget to drain the pasta.</li>
                <li>Add the Sour Cream (one spoonful, two spoonfuls or more, up to you) on steaming hot pasta, add salt, pepper and garlic/garlic powder to taste.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the grated cheese to taste.</li>
                <li>Mix, or don't.</li>
                <li>Dig in, and jó étvágyat!</li>                                   
            </ul>
